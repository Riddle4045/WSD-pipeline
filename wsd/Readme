This folder contains codes for training of classifiers based on Google Image search engine.

How it works:

1) User provides a text keyword, e.g. "Apple".
2) Download at most 110 images per sense from Google.
3) Train text classifiers using Yarosky's algorithm.
4) Train K-means model for image classification.
5) Predict the sense of object based on both text and image scores.
