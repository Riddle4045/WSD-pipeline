Many a surprised angler has retrieved his lure only to find half          of it missing, the other half swimming away in the belly of a          Peacock.         Once you have a Peacock on your line, you better have          a death grip on your rod because these behemoths have been known to jerk the          pole right out of the hands of an unprepared angler, leaving them holding          nothing but air. Set the hook hard and watch the show as your catch starts its          run. Diving deep and then shooting skyward like an sky rocket out of control,          twisting and shaking its massive body in an attempt to throw your          lure.         Peacock Bass or Peacock          Pavon, as they are known in Venezuela are fighters, or more accurately they are          like bar room brawlers. With a bag of tricks, enormous strength and great          leaping ability, these creatures will attempt to out-muscle you and show you          who is really the boss of these still, calm waters.         The Peacock Pavon is the          big brother of the cichlid family. The other members, though smaller in size          are just as ferocious as their larger relative.          Pictured in the column to          the right are the other members of the family; the Butterfly Pavon, the          Speckled Pavon and the Royal Pavon.         All Pavons are spectacular          leapers and worthy opponents and promising an experience to remember for all          anglers, whether you are a novice or world class sport fisherman.         So if you would like to          make the memory of of battling a Peacock Bass deep in the interior of          Venezuela, give Sportventure a call and let them help you create a memory for a          life time.

TOP WATER.Over the years I has told countless people that they  haven't caught a redfish until they have done it on the surface. It is one of  the most exciting things to watch when you make a cast at a school of fish and  get to see a red come out of the school like a torpedo chasing its target. Just  before they are close enough to take the bait they lift their heads out of the  water. You can see a hole form in the water and the fishes eyes as he busts your  lure.We have also been having some pretty good trout days over  the past few weeks. Most have been around 4 to 6 pounds but they have been happy  to take a top water plug as well. We are also catching some nice snook around  the mangroves and docks and a few tarpon as well. Needles to say, it is a pretty  good time to get a line wet.RedfishWe have a few schools of reds starting to work the flats here in Cocoa Beach. I  wish I could tell you where they were hanging out but it has been different from  day to day. One day the are working the skinny water in less than a foot and the  next they are working the deeper edges of the flats in up to 4 feet. The trick  has been to find the smaller schools of bait that are all over the flats. None  of the reds we have caught have been near the larger schools of mullet.Our best catches have come on the 3.25 FS Rip Roller and  the 4.25 FS Original High Roller. Now that the water has become a little more  stable we have sped up our retrieve and started try to make our bait look like  something running. This works great with the larger fish as long as you keep it  in front of them and make it look like something trying to get away.Rattle Mullet has been the fly of choice around these  fish. It has also been great on days when the puffers are all over the flats. It  hasn't been rocket science. Stick it in front of them and strip fast. Trust me,  they can catch up.TroutOur best trout bite has been in the early morning or in mid afternoon. All have  been in the sandy pockets in areas where there is a lot of larger mullet. Our  best luck has come on the 4.25 FS High Roller on calm days and the 4.25 Rip  Roller on the windier days. When you are looking to catch big trout remember it  is all about the long cast. I also try to always put the sun in my face so that  the fish don't see us as well. Our best catches have come in 2 feet or less. The  trick has been to pole in the deeper water and work the shallows.On fly the ticket has been Bubble Heads. This is one of  the most unique top water flies to hit the market in a while. It spits and  sprays driving the trout crazy. When working any top water fly for trout make  sure you make the fly make some noise. Most poppers imitate the sound of  something striking the surface. With that in mind you want to make sure any  trout within 4 or 5 feet feels she is missing out and needs to get get it before  someone else does.Tarpon  and  SnookThe snook have been working the docks of Cocoa Beach pretty good over the past  few weeks. Our best catches have come in areas where the water is at least 3  feet or deeper under the dock. As the water warms up even more we will start to  see more of them in shallower water. All of our fish have been in areas where  there have been a lot of glass minnows or smaller mullet. We have caught a few  on top water but most are being caught on small grubs or twitch baits.The tarpon are tarpon. As normal they do what they want when they want. We may  see a lot of them in one place then not again for a week. I think since the  water is warming up they are starting to move around more in search of bait.  Last year when they did this they all started moving out to the deeper edge of  the flats near sandbars not to far from their winter holes.Other stuffMany of you have asked me over the years about the Fishing Lanyard I wear. I  have started making them for the Fly Fisherman and they now have them in both  stores. These make a great gift for the fisherman that has everything else.  I  now  also  have  them  on  my  website  at  this  link   Fishing  Lanyards.until next time.....Get out there and catch a memory.Capt.

(Photo by Matt Williams)       FLW Outdoors Magazine - March - April 2002      A fish called Wanda   By Matt Williams&nbsp;-&nbsp; 01.Mar.2002                                   Big bass prefer their meals super-sized    Graceful they are, but polite they are not. A big largemouth bass with a healthy appetite doesn't know the meaning of table manners.    It's more like a fine-tuned eating machine that knows only four modes of operation: catch, kill and swallow. The fourth comes as natural as the first three: start over and repeat the process until the tummy gets full.     So, just how often does a big bass feed? That's a $50,000 question if ever there was one.    Considering its stature in the pecking order, it's only logical to assume a lunker largemouth eats anytime it gets ready. But ask the experts and they'll tell you feeding cycles fluctuate tremendously during the course of the year, usually in coincidence with the changing seasons.     As seasonal weather patterns change, so does a bass' metabolic rate. When water temperatures are moderate during spring and fall, big bass are much more active than in the heat of the summer or dead of winter.    That's not to say fat fish don't eat during the latter two seasons. They do. But the major eating generally takes place less frequently and doesn't last near as long.     Seasonal changes also play a role in when big bass go on the prowl. Take spring, for instance.    Longer days and extended warming trends cause a noticeable rise in water temperatures. Big bass react to the change accordingly, usually by levitating vertically in the water column and gravitating towards the sun-baked shallows, often with an attitude that can be overly aggressive at times.     Perhaps this explains why so many big fish are caught during the midday hours in spring when surface temps are usually at their warmest.    Directly the opposite occurs during the summer months. The best summer fishing typically occurs during low light periods ‚Äî early in the morning, late in the afternoon and night ‚Äî when water temperatures are coolest. At times, these feeding periods may become predictable enough to set a watch by.    To illustrate this point, consider an experiment conducted in July 1986 on little Houston County Lake near Crockett, Texas. Big-bass guru John Hope implanted a small electronic transmitter in a 12-pound largemouth he'd caught the previous spring. The fish was nicknamed ‚ÄúWanda.‚Äù    Using special telemetry gear, Hope was able to track the fish and observe her movements on a daily basis. The fishing guide noticed a definite change in Wanda's behavior once late spring gave way to summer and hot weather set in.    The fish spent the daylight hours in a suspended state, usually over deep water, and only became active at night, normally at about 9 p.m. At that point, she would move out of deep water and cruise parallel with a nearby shoreline in about 8 feet of water. The activity usually continued into the wee hours of the morning.    ‚ÄúI can't say for certain, but I assume she was feeding when she was moving up and down that shoreline,‚Äù Hope said. ‚ÄúIn my opinion, a fish that is feeding is a catchable fish.‚Äù    Hope proved that point several weeks down the road when he tracked Wanda to the same shoreline and caught her as she made her midnight rounds. The fish ate a buzzbait, but Hope wasn't working it in the conventional manner.    ‚ÄúI could hear some sort of ‚Äòswooshing' noise beneath the surface with my headphones,‚Äù he recalled. ‚ÄúI assumed it might be some sort of baitfish trying to get away. So I tried to think of a lure that might imitate that sound.‚Äù    Hope cast a buzzbait, let it sink and then ripped it off the bottom by sweeping his rod sideways. This caused the blade to spin and likewise created a sound that was a near match to the natural one he'd heard minutes earlier.    Bingo. A few casts later, he was cradling Wanda for a second time.    Hope will never know for certain what type of forage Wanda was feeding on prior to pouncing on his buzzbait. He assumed it was shad. But considering the largemouth's predatory nature, it could have just as easily been a school of sunfish, crappie or bass.    Todd Driscoll, a Jasper-based fisheries biologist with the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department, says largemouth bass aren't that selective when it comes to satisfying an empty gut. When the dinner bell rings, anything is fair game.    ‚ÄúA largemouth bass is like any other predator ‚Äî it's not all that picky about what it eats,‚Äù Driscoll says. ‚ÄúBass eat all kinds of critters. Except during the periods when they are schooling in open water, bass are predominantly shoreline feeders. Therefore, their diet is comprised mostly of the types of forage you find in that type of water: shad, crawfish and sunfish.‚Äù    There are, however, some exceptions to the rule.    Largemouth have been known to dine on their own kind. Driscoll says the cannibalistic urge probably occurs more frequently during the spring than any other season, mainly because of the sheer numbers of young bass found in the shallows during that period.    Bass also have been known to eat other types of sport fish on occasion.    During a recent trip to Lake Nacogdoches in eastern Texas, my wife and I came across a 6-pound largemouth floating on its side. Closer examination revealed the fish had more than a mouthful. There was a 1 1/4-pound crappie wedged in her mouth.    I snatched the bass by her lower lip and brought her into the boat. It took some coaxing, but I worked the dead crappie free. We watched the big bass swim away a few minutes later.    Driscoll wasn't surprised to learn about the big bass/big crappie episode. That's because big fish are typically more prone to seek out a few sizeable meals as opposed to several small ones.     ‚ÄúA big bass will typically optimize its foraging capabilities by eating a few big meals as opposed to expending all the energy of chasing around a bunch of little ones,‚Äù he said.    That brings to surface another $50,000 question. How much does a healthy 10-pound bass eat?    No one really knows for certain, because it is virtually impossible to monitor such a fish in a wild environment. But based on what he's seen in controlled settings, fisheries biologist David Campbell believes big fish have an equally large appetite.    Campbell has been involved with the Texas ShareLunker program since its inception in 1986. The program solicits the donation of Texas-caught bass weighing 13 pounds or more for use in spawning and genetics research.    Campbell has handled some 323 ShareLunkers over the last 15 years. So he arguably has more hands-on experience with double-digit bass than anyone in Texas, quite possibly in the world.    The fisheries scientist believes feeding patterns in big bass vary from fish to fish, just as they do in people. Some big bass may be so aggressive that they eat or kill everything in their path for the heck of it. Others are more passive and eat only until they get their fill.    ‚ÄúEvery big bass has a different personality,‚Äù says Campbell. ‚ÄúThey're sort of like horses. Some horses have real good dispositions, whereas others want to kick at everything that walks by. I think you see the same thing with big bass. It's just another wild animal.‚Äù    The most aggressive bass Campbell has ever dealt with was the 16-pound, 3-ounce largemouth Troy Johnson caught from Gibbons Creek Reservoir in Central Texas in 1988. Johnson's fish was an extremely aggressive feeder, as reflected in the 2 ¬Ω pounds she gained during her yearlong stay in the 3,500-gallon lunker tank.    On several occasions, Campbell saw the fish consume as many as 12 7-inch channel catfish in a single setting.    ‚ÄúShe ate over 200 pounds of food in the year we had her,‚Äù recalled Campbell. ‚ÄúThere were times when she might go a couple of days without eating much. But when she did decide to feed, she ate everything we put in front of her.‚Äù    Perhaps she thought it would be rude if she didn't clean her plate.

Number 2 closures go into effect                                   Sunday night, March 23. This spring, all stocking                                   trucks will be loaded with a mix of mostly standard-sized,                                   10‚Äù to 11‚Äù rainbow trout to include several nets-full                                   per tank of 2-year holdovers averaging 14‚Äù-15‚Äù                                   long. In addition several 3-year old jumbos will                                   go on each truck load. Some of these brutes weigh                                   in at nearly 3 to 4 pounds or more!!! These are                                   real nice fish folks; enjoy them.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         This week we stocked the following areas that                                   are now open to fishing (0 Closure Areas). The                                   Patapsco River at Daniels (2/day) finally got                                   its pre-season stocking of 3000 trout on Wednesday,                                   March 12. Trout were stocked from Daniels Dam                                   downstream to the I-70 Bridge at which point the                                   4WD pickup truck used to stock this area bogged                                   down in the heavy snow and could go no further.                                   In addition, several hundred trout were stocked                                   above the Daniels Dam. The Patuxent River Catch                                   & Return Area (2000) and the Middle Patuxent River                                   Delayed Harvest Area (500) will be stocked with                                   brown trout on Friday, March 14. Members of the                                   Potomac/Patuxent Chapter of Trout Unlimited will                                   help float stock these browns throughout both                                   special areas Also stocked were Tuckahoe at Crouse                                   Mill (1500), and Avalon Pond (under 16 over 65,                                   250, completely frozen). In Garrett and Allegany                                   Counties trout were stocked in the North Branch                                   at Barnum and Piedmont as well as in the Casselman                                   River Delayed Harvest Area. Jennings Run, located                                   in Allegany County, was stocked along Rt. 36 between                                   Corriganville and Barrelville. Jennings Run is                                   a #2-3 closure stream and will remain open to                                   fishing until 10:00pm, March 23                                                                                      March 3 to March 7, 2003 -                               This is the last week of &#147;pre-season&#148;                               trout stocking. Unfortunately, ice and snow continues                               to play havoc with our pre-season trout stocking schedule.                               Unplowed parking lots, pull-offs and access roads                               have prevented us from stocking many areas. In Garrett                               County its still full bore winter, deep snow and thick                               ice everywhere.                            As a result, the following areas did NOT receive                               their scheduled, pre-season stocking of trout: Jennings                               Run, Rocky Gap Lake, Battie Mixon Pond, North Branch                               Potomac, Town Creek delayed harvest, Hamburg &amp;                               Whiskey Springs Ponds, Little Tonoloway Creek (upper),                               Little Antietam Creek (under 16), Morgan Run catch                               &amp; return, Farm Museum Pond, Westminster Pond,                               Bennett Cerf Pond, Patapsco River at Daniels, Lake                               Waterford, Stansbury Park Pond, Little Patuxent River,                               Howards Pond and the Tuckahoe. We will get trout into                               these areas as soon as time and weather permit. I&#146;ll                               keep you posted.                                                                                                                                                                               This week, March 3 to 7, the following ice-free                               areas received their pre-season stocking of trout:                               Youghiogheny River at both Oakland and Friendsville,                               Patuxent River catch &amp; return, Middle Patuxent                               River delayed harvest, Hugesville Pond, Calvert Cliff                               Pond, Allens Pond, Hutchins Pond, School House Pond,                               Melwood Pond, Tucker Pond and Myrtle Grove. The following                               lakes were also stocked but were mostly or entirely                               ice covered: Elkhorn Lake, Rainbow Lake, Lake Needwood,                               Centennial Lake, Piney Reservoir, Cosca Lake, and                               Allens Pond. Big Pool may be stocked on Friday depending                               on access. When these areas thaw out the trout will                               be waiting for you. Be sure to check the 2003 Sportfishing                               Guide (page 34) for upcoming closure periods that                               will affected several of the lakes and ponds listed                               above. Some of these areas have a #2 closure and fishing                               will be prohibited beginning March 23, 10:00pm to                               March 29, 5:30am.                                                                                                                        Feb. 24 to Feb. 28, 2003 -                           Winter refuses to release its icy grip on                           Maryland‚Äôs pre-season trout stocking schedule. Many of                           the parking lots, boat ramps and access roads to pre-season                           streams and ponds are not plowed and the remaining snow,                           several inches to several feet thick, has set like concrete                           with a glassy slick surface almost impossible to walk                           on. To add insult to injury, as of Thursday, February                           27, we are in the midst of yet another sizable snowstorm.                           But none the less, to keep from falling too far behind,                           stocking trucks were rolling out of Albert Powell Trout                           Hatchery this week to areas we could get to. Keep in mind                           that access and parking at many of these areas will remain                           difficult until snow conditions improve.                         This week we stocked trout in the following areas                           that are relatively ice free and fishable. Due to the                           snow, parking may be a problem at some areas: Shad Landing                           500, Salisbury Park Pond 750, Wheatley Lake 2000 (some                           ice), Artemesia lake 500 (some ice), and Antietam Creek                           ‚Äì 1000.                                                                                                                                            The following lakes received their pre-season stocking                             this week however they were all completely covered with                             ice ranging in thickness from skim ice up to 18‚Äù: Liberty                             Reservoir, Greenbelt Lake; Greenbrier Lake, Blairs Valley                             Lake and Cunningham Falls Lake. Ice fishing is permitted                             at Blairs Valley Lake and Greenbrier Lake only.                          There will most assuredly be snow-related changes                             to our stocking during the next couple of weeks, so                             log-on each week for another Trout Stocking Update.                                                                                             Feb. 17 to Feb. 21, 2003 - This                           week, February 17‚Äì21, was scheduled to be our first week                           of preseason trout stocking. But needless to say, this                           weekend‚Äôs massive snowstorm put an end to any thoughts                           of stocking trout. We will be watching weather and road                           conditions closely and will begin stocking as soon as                           we can get the trucks to the scheduled areas. Keep in                           mind that access roads to boat ramps, ponds, lakes and                           streams are some of the last areas to be plowed. To make                           matters worse, many parking lots for lakes and ponds are                           used as snow dumping areas. So it may be a long time before                           we can get to these areas. I‚Äôll keep you posted as soon                           as the trucks begin to roll.                        This year‚Äôs trout stocking program promises to be                           a good one in spite of last year‚Äôs record-breaking drought.                           For the most part, trout at our State facilities grew                           nicely and we have a good supply 1.5, 2.5 and 3.5 year                           old trout. Some of the largest of the 3.5 year old trout                           at Albert Powell Trout Hatchery are up to about 6 pounds                           each. Spring can‚Äôt be that far away.                                            &nbsp;

who is the Event Manager and Marketing Coordinator of American Fishing Wire/HI-SEAS. It was with great pride and excitement that HI-SEAS recently announced that they were the exclusive line sponsor of the BassMasters Weekend Tournament Series. Mike Shields, Vice President of Sales and Marketing. stated, &ldquo;Our involvement in tournament bass fishing has grown dramatically in recent years and competitive anglers all over the country are finding that they can depend on HI-SEAS products when the money&rsquo;s on the line!&rdquo;         The BassMasters Weekend Series is comprised of a total of 125 tournaments which offer over $7 Million in payout and contingencies to weekend warriors across the nation. It is the proving ground where thousands of competitive anglers hone their skills working towards a chance to move up into the professional ranks. The culmination is the Weekend Series Championship where the top boater/angler has the opportunity for a $205,000 pay day along with achieving his dream&mdash;advancing to the ultimate fishing competition in the world, the BassMasters Classic. The top co-angler can win over $100,000 is cash and prizes!         HI-SEAS has gained a strong presence in tournament angling because of its superior performing products. These fine products were designed to meet the highly specialized needs of anglers who use a variety of techniques and tackle combinations. After years of being the top line in the biggest saltwater tournament venue in the nation HI-SEAS turned its sights on competitive bass fishing. In a few short years, working with the American Bass Anglers, it had an entire tournament series named after its popular Grand Slam line and anglers everywhere are raving about their products. As a result of that association, bass anglers across the country began to discover the many great line products they offer. Here are a couple of the new products ..         White Lighting &ndash;     This is a true test-rated fluorescent-clear, micro-thin diameter monofilament with sensitivity that exceeds braids. It&rsquo;s engineered from a new co-polymer matrix making it thin, extremely strong, and has less stretch than most other monofilament lines. White Lighting has great knot strength and its supple texture makes it perfect for both spinning and conventional casting reels.         Black Widow &ndash;     This line is a thin-diameter premium co-polymer line that incorporates multi-color camouflaging technology (black-grey-red). The coloring of the line makes it almost impossible for a fish to see. The line is very supple and has low memory so it won&rsquo;t be coiling up when you cast. www.hiseas.net.            Rat-L-Trap &ndash;    Bill Lewis&rsquo; legendary invention, the Rat-L-Traps&reg;, is a lure of all seasons. In the early years Bill Lewis sold various baits from the back of his old Ford (&ldquo;rattle-trap&rdquo;) station wagon. On more than one trip Bill had no choice but to sell his products below cost just to earn enough gas money to get back home. Things have changed a great deal since those days. The Rat-L-Trap is now a bait known throughout the world and it remains one of the best bass fishing lures of all times.         Last year when I visited with Plant Manager Everitt Gill he told me that the company had sold more than 150 million lures which are distributed to all 50 states and dozens of countries around the world. The Rat-L-Trap is a bait that practically replicates the sound of distressed baitfish with its Lin-N-Sound technology. I can assure you that if you don&rsquo;t have a Rat-L-Trap in your tacklebox you are missing out on some good fishing. Just ask pro angler Boyd Duckett who won the 2007 BASS Master Classic using a red Rat-L-Trap. When the fishing gets tough the Rat-L-Trap always comes through.          Tail Chaser &ndash;     Just when you thought that Bill Lewis Lures had done everything possible with their product line they come out with the Tail Chaser. This bait brings the most realistic sounding bait to life with an incredible life-like Tail Kicking action.             Well there you are, a quick look at some exciting new baits that will be coming your way in 2008. I predict that you will have a banner year of catching when you use some of these baits. -- JB         ***********************************************************         Headlines In The Year 2029         I was gazing at some of the new items on the market and was amazed at how much the world has really changed.

A billion is a difficult number to comprehend, but one advertising agency did a good job of putting that figure into some perspective in one of its releases.     A. A billion seconds ago it was 1959.     B. A billion minutes ago Jesus was alive.     C. A billion hours ago our ancestors were living in the Stone Age.     D. A billion days ago no-one walked on the earth on two feet.     E. A billion dollars ago was only 8 hours and 20 minutes, at the rate our government is spending it. Washington, D.C .. HELLO!!! ...
